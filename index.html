<h1>CIS-128-Mobile Web App Development</h1>

<p><img src="20171017_135358.jpg"> My name is Sean Baluyot.  I am a full time employee at a clinical research organization, student, husband, and father to three boys.  I enjoy making music, playing basketball, watching the 49ers and Warriors, and travelling the world with my family.  I also have a pitbull (Craig), and two weiner dogs (Oscar and Cuba).  

<p>I'm attending this class because my company is kind enough to guide me and fulfill my dream in receiving a degree in CIS.  I have had a love for computers ever since I got my hands on one in elementary school.  I look forward to any knowledge that I will gain and will certainly pass down my skills to my children.  I would love to have a family of programmers that will shape our own and/or the public's future.</p>
