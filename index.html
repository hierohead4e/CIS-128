<h1>CIS-128-Mobile Web App Development</h1>

<p><img src="20171017_135358.jpg" alt="Sean" style="width:150px;height:150px;"> My name is Sean Baluyot.  
My mother is from the Philippines and my father is from Ecuador.  Both of them met here in the Bay Area where I was born and raised.
I have a brother and two sisters who I have not met since I did not know my father.  He passed several years ago from pancreatic cancer.
Now, I am a full time employee at a clinical research organization, student, husband, and father to three boys.  
I enjoy making music, playing basketball, watching the 49er and Warrior games, and travelling the world with my family. 
I also have a pitbull (Craig) and two Weiner dogs (Oscar and Cuba).  My goal in life is to provide for my family and make sure they do
not suffer from any stress that this unbalanced world brings forth.

<p>I'm attending this class because my company is kind enough to guide me and fulfill my dream in receiving a degree in CIS.  
I have had a love for computers ever since I got my hands on one in elementary school.  
I look forward to any knowledge that I will gain and will certainly pass down my skills to my children.  
I would love to have a family of programmers that will shape our own and/or the public's future.</p>
